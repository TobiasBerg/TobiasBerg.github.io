Visual Studio Code recently released support for the touchBar on macOS.

Ever since getting the new Macbook Pro with touchBar, doing things like refactor rename in webStorm has been a pain, so when I saw this news I jumped on vscode right away to test it out and see if it is finally better than webStorm.

To make it easier to rename things in vscode I have created a tiny extension which adds a simple button on the touchBar which lets me access the rename function faster.

Check out the code here:
